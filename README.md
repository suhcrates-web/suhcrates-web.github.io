Hi! I am a second-year M.S. student at Yonsei University.  I am currently at the ML3 lab of professor [**Jaehyung Kim**](https://sites.google.com/view/jaehyungkim)  for a research exchange.  I was previously advised by professor [**Jinyoung Yeo**](https://jinyeo.weebly.com/). I received B.S. in Educational Science from Yonsei University. I also served as a journalist specializing in data analysis in [Donga Ilbo](https://www.donga.com/), which is one of the top major newspapers in South Korea.

## Research Interest  (ML, NLP)

I am interested in improving the architecture of LLMs. Current LLMs rely solely on next-token prediction, which I believe is suboptimal for many tasks (e.g., abstract thinking, reasoning, memory management, self-awareness). In this context, I have been conducting research on **latent reasoning, discrete diffusion LM, continual knowledge learning, and self-awareness of LLM.**
